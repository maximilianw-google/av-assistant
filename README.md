# Advanced Verification Assistant

## üöÄ Overview

The Advanced Verification Assistant is a web application designed to help users prepare and pre-screen their business verification data before submitting it for official processes like Google's Advanced Verfication. It provides a multi-step form to collect business details and required documentation, then leverages an AI-powered agent to analyze the submitted information and provide actionable feedback.

The primary goal is to identify potential issues, inconsistencies, or missing information early, increasing the likelihood of a successful official verification.

**Key Features:**
* **Multi-Step Data Submission:** Guides users through providing business details and uploading necessary documents/images.
* **AI-Powered Analysis:** Utilizes an LLM agent to review submissions against common verification criteria.
* **Structured Feedback:** Presents analysis results with a high-level summary and detailed, aspect-by-aspect feedback (Green/Yellow/Red status, justification, and evidence).
* **In-Memory File Processing:** Files are handled in memory for the analysis transaction, from frontend upload to backend processing by the AI agent, without intermediate storage on GCS for this specific workflow.
* **Python-Powered Frontend:** Built with [Mesop](https://google.github.io/mesop/), allowing for UI development purely in Python.


## ‚ú® Features & Functionality

* **User Interface:**
    * **Step 1: Business Details:** Collects primary business name, address, and mailing addresses.
    * **Step 2: Upload Required Items:** A unified section for all document and image uploads with clear instructions for each item.
    * **Step 3: Review & Submit:** Allows users to review all entered information and the list of uploaded files before submitting for AI analysis.
    * **Step 4: Analysis Feedback:** Displays the structured feedback from the AI agent, including an overall summary and detailed RYG status for various verification aspects.
* **Backend Analysis:**
    * Receives business details and file data (bytes) from the frontend.
    * Utilizes an LLM Agent to perform a comprehensive review.
    * The agent analyzes text, image content (multimodal), and consistency across provided information.
    * Returns a structured JSON response detailing the findings.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Frontend:**
    * [Mesop](https://google.github.io/mesop/): Python-based web UI framework.
* **Backend:**
    * Python with FastAPI.
    * Agent Development Kit (ADK) for LLM agent interaction.
    * Underlying LLM: Google Gemini via the ADK.
* **Data Handling (for analysis transaction):**
    * Files are uploaded in the Mesop frontend and their bytes are passed to the backend API.
    * The backend passes these bytes directly to the LLM agent for in-memory processing.
    * No intermediate file storage is used during this analysis workflow.
* **Authentication:**
    * Uses Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP).


## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

This section would typically include instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Python (e.g., 3.10+)
* A Google Cloud Platform project with billing enabled.
* A Gemini API Key. See [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key) for details.


### Run Locally

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  Set up a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Add your Gemini API key to an environment variable:
    ```
    export GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
    ```
5.  Ensure you are logged into google cloud
    ```
    gcloud auth application-default login
    gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
    ```  
6.  Run **Backend (FastAPI/ADK):**
    ```bash
    cd backend-adk
    uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8008
    ```
7.  Run **Frontend (Mesop):**
    ```bash
    cd frontend-mesop
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
    ```

### Deploy to Google Cloud

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  Ensure you are logged into google cloud
    ```
    gcloud auth application-default login
    gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
    ```  
3.  Create a Artifacts Registry remote repository:
    ```bash
    gcloud artifacts repositories create av-assistant-app \
      --repository-format=docker \
      --location=us-central1 \
      --description="Docker repository for AV Assistant."
    ```
4.  Build and push the images for front and backend.
    ```bash
    gcloud builds submit --config ./cloudbuild.yaml .
    ```
5.  Run terraform by providing a backend to store state.
    ```bash
    cd terraform
    terraform init -backend-config="bucket=<your-env-bucket-name>"
    terraform apply -var-file=env/<your-env>.tfvars -auto-approve
    ```
